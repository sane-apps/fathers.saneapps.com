## Build

```bash
~/SaneApps/clients/translations/.venv/bin/python scripts/build_site.py
```

Reads:

- `~/SaneApps/clients/translations/books/ante-nicene-topics/`
- `~/SaneApps/clients/translations/books/origen-prayer-martyrdom/`
- `~/SaneApps/clients/translations/books/julian-of-eclanum/`
- `data/explore/` (stance tags + rupture captions for `/explore/`)

Writes `dist/`. Cross-refs live in `WORK_TOPICS` inside `scripts/build_site.py`.

## Ship (one command)

Build → smoke key URLs → Cloudflare Pages deploy → print CSS `?v=` hash:

```bash
./scripts/ship.sh
```

Dry-run (no deploy):

```bash
./scripts/ship.sh --dry-run
```

Needs the translations venv (PyYAML) and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (usually via `source ~/.config/nv/env`).

## `dist/` policy

**Never hand-edit `dist/`.** Edit builder + `assets/` (+ explore data / books), then rebuild.
See `docs/DIST.md`. A hand-patched `dist/` was once ahead of source and a rebuild would have wiped `/contribute/`.

## Prepped Homilies (Pass B queue, read-only)

List machine-crib `prepped` claims still waiting on Pass B (does not touch the translations tree):

```bash
python3 scripts/list_prepped_pass_b.py
```

## Deploy

Prefer `./scripts/ship.sh`. Manual path:

Cloudflare Pages project `fathers-site` → custom domain `fathers.saneapps.com`.

```bash
source ~/.config/nv/env
npx --yes wrangler@4 pages deploy dist --project-name fathers-site --commit-dirty=true
```

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory dist
```
